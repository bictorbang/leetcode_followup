## Notes

Below are some personal notes about the problems.

#### 217. Contains Duplicate

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 4ms (90.77%)

Memory: 31.54MB (43.04%)

Nothing to say there.

#### 242. Valid Anagram

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 5ms (93.55%)

Memory: 17.87MB (48.55%)

Nice use of Counters.

#### 1. Two Sum

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 0ms (100%) 

Memory: 18.91MB (22.62%)

Compute `target - x` and using a dictionary to solve the problem in O(n)

#### 49. Group Anagrams

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 11ms (83.37%) 

Memory: 20.59MB (74.80%)

I kept going for the bruteforce method with Counters because of the previous anagram problem... Then I remembered the sorting trick. 

#### 347. Top K Frequent Elements

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 4ms (71.54%)

Memory: 21.30MB (47.79%)

One liner, that uses a built-in function. I'm not reinventing the wheel :\)

I'm definitely remembering the heapq method though. 

#### 271. Encode and Decode Strings

Date: 23.01.2025

Don't have the scores for this one. (PREMIUM)
Relatively easy problem, just had to think of a nice way to encode. Got reminded of Run-Length Encoding (thank you, ENSEA) and went with it. Ultimately, the encoded string looks like this: 

`"l0#w0l1#w1l2#w2l3#w3l4#w4l5#w5"`

Where `ln` is the length of the n-th word `wn`. The delimiter could be any character as long as it's not a digit (otherwise it messes up with the stop condition).

#### 238. Product of Array Except Self

Date: 24.01.2025

Runtime: 27ms (49.76%)

Memory: 23.23MB (66.93%)

Tough problem, "elegant" solution ? The runtime exceeded when bruteforcing. The trick is to split the list into a prefix and a suffix, and to notice that the first suffix contains every suffix ahead. Likewise, the last prefix contains every prefix before ; this allows us to save time computing only two loops for the products.

#### 36. Valid Sudoku

Date: 24.01.2025

Runtime: 0ms (100%)

Memory: 17.65MB (63.35%)

Three rules to verify, so three ifs. Storing the data in hashmaps or whatever to avoid unneccessary computation. I'm seeing a pattern here. It's all about optimization LOL

#### 128. Longest Consecutive Sequence

Date: 24.01.2025

Runtime: 43ms (82.97%)

Memory: 34.32MB (26.31%)

The challenge here is to avoid using any sorting algorithm, in order to find a function that runs in O(n) time. But it's not very hard to come up with a satisfactory solution.

For each element in the set (duplicates are ignored), check if it's a lower bound (i.e the first number of a consecutive sequence), and then compute the length of the consecutive sequence. 

#### 1929. Concatenation of Arrays

This one is just trivial (in Python at least). I wonder why it's there ?

#### 146. LRU Cache

OrderedDicts are the best objects for this task. 

#### 303. Range Sum Query - Immutable

Nothing specific to add there. It's got a trick similar to **238. Product of Array Except Self** where you could store the sums to avoid overcomputation.

#### 304. Range Sum Query 2D - Immutable
