Below are some personal notes about the problems.

### 217. Contains Duplicate

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 4ms (90.77%)

Memory: 31.54MB (43.04%)

Nothing to say there.

### 242. Valid Anagram

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 5ms (93.55%)

Memory: 17.87MB (48.55%)

Nice use of Counters.

### 1. Two Sum

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 0ms (100%) 

Memory: 18.91MB (22.62%)

Compute `target - x` and using a dictionary to solve the problem in O(n)

### 49. Group Anagrams

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 11ms (83.37%) 

Memory: 20.59MB (74.80%)

I kept going for the bruteforce method with Counters because of the previous anagram problem... Then I remembered the sorting trick. 

### 347. Top K Frequent Elements

Date: 23.01.2025

Runtime: 4ms (71.54%)

Memory: 21.30MB (47.79%)

One liner, that uses a built-in function. I'm not reinventing the wheel :\)

I'm definitely remembering the heapq method though. 

### 271. Encode and Decode Strings
