# LEETCODE Followup

Hi. I want to track my leetcode progression. This repo will store my solutions.

I will follow [neetcode's roadmap](https://neetcode.io/roadmap) first, then I'll move on to other topics. This should already take a while.

I haven't decided how to sort my stuff yet, so this will be experimental and bound to change.
Currently, I plan on making folders by type, then by difficulty. 

The comments will be in English.

Wish me luck :\) 


### The Vault

This python file contains all my solutions as reusable functions.
